- Football Soccer league:
  There are 8 teams in the Globant Football League.
  As you know, each team has 11 players.
  Each player has a set of attributes: speed, stamina, mentality, control.

  o Design the database using ER Model and attach the image (in png format).
    Don't forget the relationships.
  * Create the models and relationships using sequelize. You can create all the files you want.
  * Create a new 'seed_gfsl.js' file and save the teams, the players and the attributes.
    Use faker.js to create fake data (or create new functions).
    Store the teams, players and attributes in your database.
  * Tournament time!!!!
    -- Create a new 'tournament.js' file.
    -- Simulate a tournament: Each team must play with the rest.
       So, a team must have 7 matches. 
    -- 4 matches every week.
       You will need generate a random score. (Range 0 to 5)
    -- The champion will be the team with more wins. In case of a tie, goals is the tiebreaker (just the goals scored).
    -- Show the results by week: Example:

    + ---------------------- +
    | Week 1                 |
    + -----------------------+
    | Team A vs Team B | 3 -0|
    + -----------------------+
    | Team C vs Team D | 1 -1|
    + -----------------------+
    ...
    + ---------------------- +
    | Week 2                 |
    + -----------------------+
    -- Feel free to use the format you want. Even, you can use static files on expressjs.
    -- The result of every match, must be saved in the database.
